## The questions:
<ul>
<li>How many loans are active at the beginning of November 2017?</li>
<li>What are your lower and upper bounds for the number of active loans in each month until November
2017?</li>
<li>Letâ€™s say we purchase the right to receive the payments of these loans for the next 2 years. If we can
borrow money for 12% compounded annually and want to earn principle and interest back on our
investment in the lower 5% case, what is a fair price to pay for these receivables?</li>
</ul>
